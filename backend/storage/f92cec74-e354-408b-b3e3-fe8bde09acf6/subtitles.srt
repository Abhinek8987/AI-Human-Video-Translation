00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
You work hard, you make money. You do it for yourself. That's not life.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
You go out, you seek for people who need your help. You make their lives better.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You become that sponge which can absorb all the negativity and you become that person who can admit beautiful positive vibes.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And when you realize that you have changed someone's life and because if you, this person didn't give up.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
That is the day when you listen.
